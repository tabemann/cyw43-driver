# CYW43 Firmware

This is a place to keep firmware for the CYW43439 for the Raspberry Pi Pico W separate from the rest of zeptoforth to avoid licensing complications of mixing non-free code with permissively-licensed code.

The code found here is to be uploaded to a Raspberry Pi Pico W after first flashing a zeptoforth image and prior to loading the CYW43 driver and zeptoIP, which are dependent upon this firmware.
